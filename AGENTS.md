This file is a placeholder for agent-specific instructions.
You can use this file to provide guidance to the AI agent
on how to best interact with your project.

For example, you can specify:
- The project's coding style
- The preferred testing framework
- The build and deployment process
- Any other relevant information that would help the agent
  to better understand the project and make more informed
  decisions.

**Note:** This file is not a substitute for a good README.md
file. The README.md file should still be the primary source
of information for human developers.
